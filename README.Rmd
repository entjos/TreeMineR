Implementation of tree-based scan statistics as described in [Kulldorff et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.3423) or [Kulldorff et al. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1541-0420.00039). To get started, please take a look at the [vignette](https://entjos.github.io/TreeMineR/articles/Tree-based-scan-statistics.html) or check the documentation of the main functions:
* `TreeMineR()`
* `create_tree()`
* `cut_the_tree()`

The package also includes the following pre-defined hierarchical trees, which can be used out of the box. Please check their help files for more information.
* `icd_10_se`
* `atc_codes`

## Installation

You can install the development version of TreeMineR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
