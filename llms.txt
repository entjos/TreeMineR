## Description

This package is an R implementation of tree-based scan statistics as
described in [Kulldorff et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.3423)
or [Kulldorff et al. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1541-0420.00039).
To get started, please take a look at the
[vignette](https://entjos.github.io/TreeMineR/articles/Tree-based-scan-statistics.html)
or check the documentation of the main functions:

- [`TreeMineR()`](https://entjos.github.io/TreeMineR/reference/TreeMineR.md)
- [`create_tree()`](https://entjos.github.io/TreeMineR/reference/create_tree.md)
- `cut_the_tree()`

The package also includes the following pre-defined hierarchical trees,
which can be used out of the box. Please check their help files for more
information. - `icd_10_se` - `atc_codes`

## Installation

For installing the package from CRAN please use

``` r
install.packages("TreeMineR")
```

If you would like to use the latest development version from GitHub
please use

## All functions

- [`TreeMineR()`](https://entjos.github.io/TreeMineR/reference/TreeMineR.md)
  : Unconditional Bernoulli Tree-Based Scan Statistics for R

- [`atc_codes`](https://entjos.github.io/TreeMineR/reference/atc_codes.md)
  : Hierarchical tree of the ATC system for classifying drugs

- [`create_tree()`](https://entjos.github.io/TreeMineR/reference/create_tree.md)
  :

  Creating a tree file for further use in
  [`TreeMineR()`](https://entjos.github.io/TreeMineR/reference/TreeMineR.md).

- [`diagnoses`](https://entjos.github.io/TreeMineR/reference/diagnoses.md)
  : Test dataset of ICD diagnoses

- [`drop_cuts()`](https://entjos.github.io/TreeMineR/reference/drop_cuts.md)
  : Remove cuts from your tree. This is, e.g., useful if you would like
  to remove certain chapters from the ICD-10 tree used for the analysis
  as some chapters might be a prior deemed irrelevant for the exposure
  of interest, e.g., chapter 20 (external causes of death) might not be
  of interest when comparing two drug exposures.

- [`icd_10_se`](https://entjos.github.io/TreeMineR/reference/icd_10_se.md)
  : Swedish version of the ICD-10 diagnoses code tree

- [`icd_10_se_dict`](https://entjos.github.io/TreeMineR/reference/icd_10_se_dict.md)
  : Dictionary for the Swedish version of the ICD-10 diagnoses code tree
